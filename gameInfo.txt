Given a chance to talk to suspects.
Then choose a room. (some could be locked, need to find a key).

Each room will have items to investigate. These will be added to the players inventory where they can be inspected to give hints.

Need to find out if the user wants to guess. 

Story:

The buzz of your cellphone interrupts a friendly game of croquchet. The sun beams through the tall pine trees, a sweet smell in the air.
As chief police investigator, a murder scene isn't unknown to you. Will you discover the murderer? Or will they escape your grasp?

Arriving on the police cordoned scene you discover six suspects and a large mansion. The dirty marble pillars outside hold the pearly white
roof up. You escort the suspects into the cellar in the middle of the mansion, down the stairs and onto a old wooden bench. You begin the
questioning.

[Insert first attempts at questioning, no chance to accuse anyone yet]

Start the player in the middle of the mansion. List the rooms the player can enter into. 
Some rooms will be locked - the player will need a key.
Each room will have an item hidden.
There will be lots of interactable objects the user will need to look at. Having more clues unlocks new speech options.
